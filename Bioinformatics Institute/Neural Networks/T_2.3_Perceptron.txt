 |Yellowness | symmetry | pear?
1|1          | 0.3      | yes
2|0.4        | 0.5      | yes
3|0.7        | 0.8      | no

Let's say we have a perceptron with weights (0, 0) and bias 0.
Train it on the given data to distinguish between pears and non-pears 
(do not train to convergence yet: apply the learning rule sequentially once on each example, in total, 
you will get three consecutive applications of the learning rule).

Write in the answer, separated by a comma, the resulting offset, the weight for the yellowness of the fruit, 
and the weight for its symmetry ( only the final ones, you do not need to write the results of each step).
